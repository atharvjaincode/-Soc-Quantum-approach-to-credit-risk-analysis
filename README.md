# Quantum Approach to Credit Risk Analysis

Welcome to the Quantum Approach to Credit Risk Analysis project! This repository is dedicated to exploring how quantum computing can be applied to analyze and manage credit risk.

## Overview

In this project, we will cover:

1. **Basic Theory of Credit Risk Analysis**:
    - Introduction to credit risk
    - Traditional models of credit risk assessment
    - Limitations of classical methods

2. **Quantum Methods in Credit Risk Analysis**:
    - Introduction to quantum computing concepts
    - Quantum algorithms relevant to risk analysis
    - Implementing quantum methods for credit risk
